# Service User Notes Tracker

## Challenge:

My fiance (this will become wife very soon) works in Mental Health and we discuss the systems, platforms and tools that they have available to them (or not) in her industry quite often.

One of those systems involves having to take/make notes on a Service User each day, even multiple times per day, which is often done on paper and then manually transferred to the computer system at some point later.

So I decided to build a simple application that allows for Support Workers to create notes on a s Service User.

This is the API.
